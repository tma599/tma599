This module attempts to work around this issue by waiting until those streams have been completely drained before actually calling `process.exit`.\n\nSee [Node.js issue #3584](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3584) for further reference.\n\nTested in OS X 10.8, Windows 7 on Node.js 0.8.25 and 0.10.18.\n\nBased on some code by [@vladikoff](https://github.com/vladikoff).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall the module with: `npm install exit`\n\n```javascript\nvar exit = require(\"exit\");\n\n// These lines should appear in the output, EVEN ON WINDOWS.\nconsole.log(\"omg\");\nconsole.error(\"yay\");\n\n// process.exit(5);\nexit(5);\n\n// These lines shouldn't appear in the output.\nconsole.log(\"wtf\");\nconsole.error(\"bro\");\n```\n\n## Don't believe me? Try it for yourself.\n\nIn Windows, clone the repo and cd to the `test\\fixtures` directory. The only difference between [log.js](test/fixtures/log.js) and [log-broken.js](test/fixtures/log-broken.js) is that the former uses `exit` while the latter calls `process.exit` directly.\n\nThis test was done using cmd.exe, but you can see the same results using `| grep \"std\"` in either PowerShell or git-bash.\n\n```\nC:\\node-exit\\test\\fixtures>node log.js 0 10 stdout stderr 2>&1 | find \"std\"\nstdout 0\nstderr 0\nstdout 1\nstderr 1\nstdout 2\nstderr 2\nstdout 3\nstderr 3\nstdout 4\nstderr 4\nstdout 5\nstderr 5\nstdout 6\nstderr 6\nstdout 7\nstderr 7\nstdout 8\nstderr 8\nstdout 9\nstderr 9\n\nC:\\node-exit\\test\\fixtures>node log-broken.js 0 10 stdout stderr 2>&1 | find \"std\"\n\nC:\\node-exit\\test\\fixtures>\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n\n2013-11-26 - v0.1.2 - Fixed a bug with hanging processes.  \n2013-09-26 - v0.1.1 - Fixed some bugs. It seems to actually work now!  \n2013-09-20 - v0.1.0 - Initial release.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 \"Cowboy\" Ben Alman  \nLicensed under the MIT license.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
