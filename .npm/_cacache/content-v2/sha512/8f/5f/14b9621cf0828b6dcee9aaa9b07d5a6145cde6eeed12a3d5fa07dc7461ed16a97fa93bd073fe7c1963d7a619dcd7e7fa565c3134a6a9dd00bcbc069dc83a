require('has-own-deep');\nconst obj = { a: { b: { c: 'd' } } };\n\nconsole.log(hasOwnDeep(obj, 'a'));     //=> true\nconsole.log(hasOwnDeep(obj, 'a.b'));   //=> true\nconsole.log(hasOwnDeep(obj, 'a.b.c')); //=> true\n\nconsole.log(hasOwnDeep(obj, 'c'));     //=> false\nconsole.log(hasOwnDeep(obj, 'a.c'));   //=> false\nconsole.log(hasOwnDeep(obj, 'a.b.d')); //=> false\n```\n\n## Keys with dots\n\nShould correctly detect deeply nested keys that have dots in them.\n\n```js\nconsole.log(hasOwnDeep({ 'a.b.c': 'd' }, 'a.b.c'));      //=> true\nconsole.log(hasOwnDeep({ 'a.b': { c: 'd' } }, 'a.b.c')); //=> true\nconsole.log(hasOwnDeep({ a: { 'b.c': 'd' } }, 'a.b.c')); //=> true\n```\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are
